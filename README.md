PROJECT OVERVIEW:

A To-Do List is a common web application that allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks. You can create a basic To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of the code components involved:

1. HTML (Structure)
The HTML structure creates the basic layout of the To-Do List application, including an input field for new tasks, a button to add tasks, and a list to display the tasks.
Breakdown:
Input Field: The user types in the new task here (<input type="text">).
Button: When clicked, it adds the new task to the list (<button>).
Task List: An empty <ul> element that will be populated with tasks dynamically.
CSS (Styling)
CSS is used to make the To-Do List visually appealing. It styles the layout, input field, button, and task list items.
Breakdown:
Input/Task List Styling: Defines the width, padding, and margin for the input field and tasks.
Button Styling: Adds colors and hover effects to the "Add Task" button.
Task Item Styling: Each task is styled with background color, padding, and a flex layout. A completed task will have a strikethrough effect.
